# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
My name is Zhifei Chen and you can call me Ashley. My pronous is she/her. I like ryhthm games, moba games and FPS games, such as Phigros, Muse Dash, Apex Legends, Identity V and so on. I want to transfer into the GDIM major and I've learned a liitle about modeling by using 1234D and Maya. I'd like to build a 2D game with a lot of levels. It just simulates a peoples's whole life. With the game proceeding, the level's difficulty increased which shows the different stage of a people's life.Player will need to collect the props and unlock the door to the next level. Different choosings at each level will lead to different endings.
2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [√] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class? The programming skill and ability to code a game by myself.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class? I want to get high marks in this class but the score is graded totally based on the work. I don't have a really clear understanding on the criteria. 

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

2. Game development (any engine)

3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**
